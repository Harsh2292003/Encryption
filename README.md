📚 How To Use
Clone the repository

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
Run the Frontend

Open the index.html file directly in your browser
or

Use a local server (like Live Server extension) for better performance.

Usage

Enter the text you want to encrypt ➔ Click Encrypt ➔ Copy the encrypted result.

To decrypt, paste the encrypted text ➔ Click Decrypt ➔ Get your original text back.

🔐 How It Works (Simple Overview)
Encryption:
User enters plain text.
Text is encrypted using [chosen algorithm, e.g., AES].
Output is secure cipher text.
Decryption:
User enters cipher text.
Tool decrypts it using the correct key or method.
Original text is retrieved securely.

🎯 Future Enhancements
Add option to choose different encryption algorithms (AES, RSA, etc.)
Password-protected encryption keys.
Save encrypted messages securely.
Generate QR codes for encrypted texts.
